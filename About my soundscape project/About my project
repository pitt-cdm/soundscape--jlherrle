I decided to select happiness for my soundscape project. The two audio files that I have downloaded are two of my friends 

explaning what happiness is to them. I feel like it is important to notice that happiness means different things to everybody

and I want to share that throughout my project. In the first audio clip I asked my friend Monica what happiness is to her. 

She explained that happiness to her is a bag of sour patch kids, laying in bed in her heated blanket, and getting an email 

from her professor that class is cancelled. For her happiness is objects, things that she can touch. Whereas the other audio

clip focuses more on emotions and how someone feels that makes them happy. I asked my friend Meg what happiness is to her. She

answered that happiness is being at peace with herself. Using both of these audio clips demonstrats that happiness is different

for everybody. To some people happiness means candy and a warm blanket, while others may argue that happiness to them is

within themselves. 

I hope that throughout this project I am able to share different people's outlooks on what happiness is to them. I eventually want

to go around campus and ask people that I do not know what happiness is to them. I am curious if interviewing people you have a

realtionship with versus someone you do not know will have an impact on how someone answers the question. While recording these

people I hope to capture the passion in some peoples voices when they explain what happiness is to them. At some point in the 

project I would like to add all of the interviews together so it is one single audio clip. Therefore you will really be able

to hear the difference in some peoples answers.
